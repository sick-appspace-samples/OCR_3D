## OCR_3D
Finds and read 3D letters and numbers with OCR.
### Description
The texts are raised from the objects and 3D algorithms are needed to segment
the letters and numbers. Once segmented the text is read with OCR.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the app (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show images after loading the webpage.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API, HALCON support and
AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware.
Alternatively the Emulator in AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used in conjunction
with a HALCON developer license and dongle.
